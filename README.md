# Captcha-detector-system-pipelined-with-RPA
Captcha detector system using Deep Learning then pipelined the model output to RPA process that need captcha detection as a key to complete the process.(Keras ,CNN and RPA).

# Description
Train a convolutionaL neural network to detect captcha images then pass the output of the model (the captcha letters) to RPA -(Robotic Process Automation) -  process that access certain website depending on the previous detected captcha to perform certain tasks on that website.
